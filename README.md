# AceRoofing
-My first project! A landing page for my parents business Ace Roofing, a simple project
with a few concrete goals. 

-I want this to be an attractive and enticing page that introduces the company and
sells the customer on signing up. The page should take it information from them using 
an html form and send the information to my parents email.

-This project should style with CSS but also use a little bit of javascript to create
some attractive animation, I want to keep it simple though and not get carried away.
